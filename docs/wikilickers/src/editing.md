# Editing
We don't do much editing.
The podcast is supposed to be low effort.

So, we basically just add in the intro and outro music and then release.

## Software
Any DAW (digital audio workstation) can be used to edit the tracks down.

I use [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/).  Ableton isn't free, but I'm fairly proficient in it which allows me to move quickly.
