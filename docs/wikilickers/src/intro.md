# Wikilickers
Wikilickers is a low effort podcast where we hang back and crackwise about a wikipedia article.
This podcast is just something that we do for fun and we have no plans on monetizing.

Typically episodes are around 30 minutes.


## Create your own episode
You are welcome to create your own episode.  

1. Gather your friends or enemies.
2. Choose a random or interesting wikipedia article.
3. Record yourself reading through wiki article.
4. submit your recording to wikilickers@gmail.com

We will provide a score based entirely on how well you pronounce difficult words in the article.


## Self hosting
Currently, we host the podcast on soundcloud.  
Eventually we plan on self hosting for better longevity and to achieve a lower operations cost.

### TODO
To self host, we need to build some kind of automation that builds the episodes to an RSS feed.

## Distribution
The wikilickers podcast is searchable on most podcasting platforms.
