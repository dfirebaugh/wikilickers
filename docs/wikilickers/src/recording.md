# Recording

## Multi-track
For the best audio quality, it is best if everyone is on their own individual track.
One person per microphone.



## Discord
For remote recording, we've found the [Craig](https://craig.chat/) discord bot to be pretty easy to use.

Craig will record each person as their own separate track.  You will need to use some sort of (DAW) Digital Audio Workstation (e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)) to compile the tracks together.

## Mic suggestion
Content is more important than audio quality.

Don't use a laptop's built in mic.

| quality | type | mic | notes |
| ------- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| OK | gaming headset | Most gaming headsets can provide a somewhat decent audio quality. |
|Better | standalone usb mic | [blue yeti](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/) (~$100) or the [audio-technica atr2100-usb](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/atr2100-usb) (~$80) | these are good for individuals, but it can make things difficult if you have multiple people in the same room |
| even better | xlr mic | [shure sm58](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/microphones/sm58?variant=SM58-LCE) | it might be good to have a pop filter with this kind of mic |
| best | xlr broadcast mic |  [shure sm7b](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B) (~$400) or [shure mv7](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/microphones/mv7?variant=MV7-K) | these would require an audio interface and possibly a preamp |
